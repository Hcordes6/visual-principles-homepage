                What name do I have for you?
                Certainly there is not name for you
                In the sense that the stars have names
                That somehow fit them. Just walking around,
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                An object of curiosity to some,
                But you are too preoccupied
                By the secret smudge in the back of your soul
                To say much and wander around,


            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Smiling to yourself and others.
            It gets to be kind of lonely
            But at the same time off-putting.
            Counterproductive, as you realize once again

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            That the longest way is the most efficient way,
            The one that looped among islands, and
            You always seemed to be traveling in a circle.
            And now that the end is near

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            The segments of the trip swing open like an orange.
            There is light in there and mystery and food.
            Come see it.
            Come not for me but it.
            But if I am still there, grant that we may see each other.
