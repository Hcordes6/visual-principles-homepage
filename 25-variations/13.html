            <p>
                What name do I have for you?
                Certainly there is not name for you
                In the sense that the stars have names
                That somehow fit them. Just walking around,
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                An object of curiosity to some,
                But you are too preoccupied
                By the secret smudge in the back of your soul
                To say much and wander around,
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Smiling to yourself and others.
                It gets to be kind of lonely
                But at the same time off-putting.
                Counterproductive, as you realize once again

            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                That the longest way is the most efficient way,
                The one that looped among islands, and
                You always seemed to be traveling in a circle.
                And now that the end is near

            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                The segments of the trip swing open like an orange.
                There is light in there and mystery and food.
                Come see it.
                Come not for me but it.
                But if I am still there, grant that we may see each other.
            </p>
