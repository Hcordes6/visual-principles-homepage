    <p>What name do I have for you?
        Certainly there is not name for you
        In the sense that the stars have names
        That somehow fit them. Just walking around,
        <br>
        <br>
        An object of curiosity to some,
        But you are too preoccupied
        By the secret smudge in the back of your soul
        To say much and wander around,
        <br>
        <br>
        Smiling to yourself and others.
        It gets to be kind of lonely
        But at the same time off-putting.
        Counterproductive, as you realize once again
        <br>
        <br>
        That the longest way is the most efficient way,
        The one that looped among islands, and
        You always seemed to be traveling in a circle.
        And now that the end is near
        <br>
        <br>
        The segments of the trip swing open like an orange.
        There is light in there and mystery and food.
        Come see it.
        Come not for me but it.
        But if I am still there, grant that we may see each other.
