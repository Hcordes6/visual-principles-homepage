            What name do I have for you?
            Certainly there is not name for you
            In the sense that the stars have names
            That somehow fit them. Just walking around,

            An object of curiosity to some,

            Smiling to yourself and others.
            It gets to be kind of lonely
            But at the same time off-putting.
            Counterproductive, as you realize once again

            There is light in there and mystery and food.
            Come see it.
            Come not for me but it.
