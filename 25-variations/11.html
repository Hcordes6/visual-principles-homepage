            What name do I have for you?
            Certainly there is not name for you
            In the sense that the stars have names
            That somehow fit them. Just walking around,
        </p>

    <div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            An object of curiosity to some,
            But you are too preoccupied
            By the secret smudge in the back of your soul
            To say much and wander around,


        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
        Smiling to yourself and others.
        It gets to be kind of lonely
        But at the same time off-putting.
        Counterproductive, as you realize once again

    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        That the longest way is the most efficient way,
        The one that looped among islands, and
        You always seemed to be traveling in a circle.
        And now that the end is near

    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The segments of the trip swing open like an orange.
        There is light in there and mystery and food.
        Come see it.
        Come not for me but it.
        But if I am still there, grant that we may see each other.
    </p>
