    <p>What name do I have for <strong>you</strong>?
        Certainly there is not name for <strong>you</strong>
        In the sense that the stars have names
        That somehow fit <strong>them</strong>. Just walking around,
        <br>
        <br>
        An object of curiosity to <strong>some</strong>,
        But <strong>you</strong> are too preoccupied
        By the secret smudge in the back of <strong>your</strong> soul
        To say much and wander around,
        <br>
        <br>
        Smiling to <strong>yourself</strong> and others.
        It gets to be kind of lonely
        But at the same time off-putting.
        Counterproductive, as <strong>you</strong> realize once again
        <br>
        <br>
        That the longest way is the most efficient way,
        The one that looped among islands, and
        <strong>You</strong> always seemed to be traveling in a circle.
        And now that the end is near
        <br>
        <br>
        The segments of the trip swing open like an orange.
        There is light in there and mystery and food.
        Come see it.
        Come not for <strong>me</strong> but it.
        But if <strong>I</strong> am still there, grant that <strong>we</strong> may see <em>each other</em>.
